# Particle Physics Simulation 2D (PPhys2D)

`PPhys2D` is a lightweight 2D particle physics library written in vanilla javaScript intended for use with web browsers. Some of the key features we support are:
- constrained dynamics and collisions
- abstracted particle behaviors
- Input handling utility classes
- particles, constraints, and static walls 
- 2D HTML canvas rendering
