Some of my research about modelling constrained 2D particle-based physics systems. In my paper, I investigate the extent of which penalty and relaxed-geometric constraints can model 2D particle physics systems. The focus of this investigation leaned towards the mathematical aspect of constrained systems. However, I still provided a programmatic implementation. I would like to work on this further in the future, including adding more constraint types, as well as a more detailed section about programmatic implementation.

It took me a while to research and write everything, read the paper here https://github.com/Hanson-Sun/Math-EE/blob/main/HansonS_Math_EE.pdf (HansonS_Math_EE.pdf)

This repository also includes additional files and additional for my math EE
